## Implementation Details

- **Login Page**: Includes fields for username and password with basic validation.
- **Sign-Up Page**: Includes fields for username, email, password, and confirm password with basic validation.
- **Light and ~~Dark~~ Modes**: The application supports light themes. ~~Dark mode~~ is not developed because the UI was looking worse in dark mode.
